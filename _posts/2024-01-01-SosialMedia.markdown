## Media Strategy

As the media head, I was responsible for designing and implementing an effective media strategy. We utilized various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to reach voters. The content we created included:

- **Infographics**: Presenting important data and information about Dr. Zadrak Tombeg's vision and mission.
- **Campaign Videos**: Showcasing achievements and future plans.
- **Blog Articles**: Writing in-depth articles about the proposed programs.

## Challenges Faced

During the campaign, we faced several challenges, including:

- **Hoaxes and Disinformation**: A lot of false information was circulating, so we had to work extra hard to clarify the facts.
- **Resource Limitations**: With a limited budget, we had to be creative in utilizing the available resources.

## Final Outcome

The hard work and dedication of the media team yielded satisfying results. Dr. Zadrak Tombeg successfully won the election with a significant number of votes. This experience not only enriched my skills in the media field but also provided personal satisfaction from contributing to the development of Tana Toraja.
